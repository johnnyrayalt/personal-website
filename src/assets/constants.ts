			`Haptic Paradigm is an ongoing curatorial and artistic collaboration with Chloe Alexandra Thompson. Conceptualized by Thompson as a digital, communal, generative sound installation, Haptic Paradigm is a websocket application with a series of Node.js websocket servers with a React front end.`,
			`Haptic Paradigm takes input from one user on the website at a time, with all other visitors placed in watch mode where they can view what the controlling user is manipulating the controls on screen. This is achieved by running two Websocket servers simultaneously. The front end sends input messages to a relay server, which then turns that data around and sends it back to the front end to move the on screen controls in real time for everyone in watch mode. The data is also sent to a remote server where it is processed and fed into a MAXMSP patch to generate music, sound, and visuals. That output is then broadcast using OBS to Twitch.tv. A video player is embedded in the site so everyone can see and hear the output being produced.`,
